# Notes Application Sequence Diagrams

## Overview
This repository contains sequence diagrams depicting the behavior of the Notes application when performing different actions. The diagrams illustrate the interaction between the user, browser, and server.

## 0.4: New Note Diagram
This diagram represents the process when a user creates a new note on the page [Notes App](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes) by typing in the text field and clicking the Save button. The diagram highlights the request-response cycle and how the note is stored.

## 0.5: Single Page App Diagram
This diagram depicts the sequence of events when a user navigates to the single-page application (SPA) version of the Notes App at [SPA Notes](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa). It shows how the application loads and fetches existing notes without a full-page reload.

## 0.6: New Note in Single Page App Diagram
This diagram illustrates the process of adding a new note using the SPA version of the Notes App. Unlike the traditional version, the SPA handles the note creation without refreshing the page, updating the UI dynamically.
