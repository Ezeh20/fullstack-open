# Part 1 - Introduction to React

This part consists of three simple React applications that introduce core React concepts:

## Course Info
A simple application that displays course information including course name, parts, and total number of exercises. Introduces React components, props, and basic JSX syntax.

## Unicafe
A feedback collection system for a caf√© where users can give feedback (good, neutral, bad) and see statistics. Teaches state management with the useState hook and handling events in React.

## Anecdotes
An application that displays programming anecdotes. Users can vote for anecdotes and see which one has the most votes. Demonstrates more complex state management and conditional rendering.

Each application builds on the previous concepts while introducing new React features and patterns.
